editor bug still exists where entities get messed up. reproduce by creating heaps of entities and then switching
to game, then back to editor

zoom towards mouse cursor

editor causes a crash if trying to delete a polygon + one of its points at the same time
(probably solve by having children entities and have the polygon manage its own children instead of the editor)

this causes wrong angles:
angle = position.angle_to(renderer.to_world_pos(sys.cursor_position));


this caused only the first point to get updated:
	//For(game.current_level->nav_points, {
	//	it.visited = false;
	//});

// add comments
// add todos
// add asserts
// rewrite renderer
// rewrite fonts to use stb_truetype and support ligatures!
// rewrite physics
// rewrite ui
